## Create SSH Keys

1. Make sure SSH-Agent is running `eval $(ssh-agent)`
	+ Alternatively, add this to your `~/.bashrc`:
	```bash
	eval $(ssh-agent) > /dev/null`
	source ~/Dropbox/Ubuntu/scripts/ssh-find-agent.sh
	set_ssh_agent_socket
	```
2. Check to see if you have any existing keys: `ls ~/.ssh`
3. Create your SSH keys: `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "you.email@example.com"`
4. Add your ssh keys to the SSH Agent: `ssh-add -t 15552000 ~/.ssh/id_rsa` The `-t` flag specifies a timeout value is in seconds. 15552000 seconds is six months. 

## Add your public key to your destination

### Using an online service such as GitHub, DigitalOcean, or Heroku

1. Download and install xclip. `sudo apt-get install xclip`
2. Use xclip to copy your ssh-keys to the clipboard `xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
3. Paste this into the online form. 

### Using a remote server and `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`

1. Using tunneled password, SSH into the machine and append the public key to your remote server's authorized_keys file. `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh you.email@example.com"mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"`
