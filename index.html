  <p>I am a graduate student in bioinformatics at The University of British Columbia. I am studying the integrative analysis of transcriptomic and metabolomic in sepsis patients. Most of my time is spent switching between the R programming language and shell scripting.</p>
  <p>I have always had a passion for technology, and in my spare time I like to hack things together. Currently I am interested in digging further development by learning JavaScript. </p>
  <p>Other things I care am interested in include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Running 🏃</li>
    <li>Baking 🍰</li>
