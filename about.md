title: About Me
---

Welcome! I am a graduate student in bioinformatics at The University of British Columbia. I am studying the integrative analysis of transcriptomic and metabolomic in sepsis patients. Most of my time is spent switching between the R programming language and shell scripting.

I have always had a passion for technology, and in my spare time I like to hack things together. Currently I am interested in learning front-end development. 

Other things I care am interested in include:  
- Running  
- Baking  
- Coffee
